# ðŸ§  Frontend Agents â€“ Bill Tracker Dashboard

This file documents reactive and UI-driven logic that works like "agents" on the frontend.

## 2. UI Totals Updater Agent

Automatically updates totals for:
- Paid
- Pending
- Overdue

**Trigger:**

## 3. Form Dialog Manager

**Purpose:**
Handles opening and closing of the Add and Edit bill dialogs.

**Components:**
- `BillForm.vue`
- `EditBillForm.vue`

## 4. Navigation Drawer Agent

**Purpose:**
Controls drawer visibility and highlights the active navigation tab based on the current route.

**Location:**
- `App.vue`

**Logic:**

## 5. Analytics Chart Data Agent

Prepares data for pie and bar charts:

> These frontend agents are reactive (computed or watcher-based) and run automatically based on state changes.
