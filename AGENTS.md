# ðŸ¤– Backend Agents â€“ Bill Tracker Dashboard

This file documents automated logic and backend processes ("agents") that run without direct user interaction.

---

## 1. Reminder Agent

**Purpose:**  
Checks bills every minute and logs or notifies if a bill is due in the next 3 days.

**Runs:**  
- Cron job via `node-cron`

**Location:**  
- `src/reminder.js`

---

## 2. Auto-Renew Agent

**Purpose:**  
Automatically creates a new bill for subscriptions after a payment is marked as "paid" and `autoRenew` is true.

**Trigger:**  
- On bill update â†’ when status changes to `"paid"`

**Logic:**
- Duplicates `name`, `description`, `amount`, `category`, `paymentProvider`, `autoRenew`
- Increments `dueDate` by 1 month
- Sets status to `"pending"`

**Location:**  
- `src/services/bill.service.js`

---

## 3. Monthly Summary Agent

**Purpose:**  
Calculates totals for `paid`, `pending`, and `overdue` bills in the current month.

**Endpoint:**  
- `GET /bills/summary`

---

## 4. Overdue Status Agent

**Purpose:**
Marks bills as `"overdue"` when their due date passes and they remain unpaid.

**Runs:**
- Invoked whenever bills are listed or summaries are generated.

**Location:**
- `src/services/billService.js` (`updateOverdueBills`)

---

## 5. Payment History Agent

**Purpose:**
Automatically records a payment entry when a bill status changes to `"paid"`.

**Trigger:**
- On bill update when status transitions to `"paid"`.

**Location:**
- `src/services/billService.js`

> Backend agents now operate on a MySQL database via Prisma.

## ðŸ›  Development Notes

- Automated tests live under `tests/` and are run with **Vitest**.
- Prisma client calls and the OpenAI library are mocked to keep tests fast and independent of external services.
- Frontend tests in `tests/frontend` are skipped for now due to CSS and Vuetify style issues in JSDOM.
- Run all tests with `npm test`.
- After implementation, create a commit and open a Pull Request with a clear title.
